# My Side Projects

Welcome to my __GitHub repository__ for **side projects**! <br />
This is a collection of small beginner projects designed to help me learn and explore different technologies, programming languages, and concepts.

<br /><br />

## Purpose
The **goal** of these projects is to:
- **Experiment** with new __ideas__ and __tools__.
- **Build** hands-on __experience__ in various domains.
- **Create** a personal reference for __learning__.

<br /><br />

## Projects
At first, these projects will be focused around **Web Development**:
- **Back end**: with native Python.
- **Front end**: with native HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
- **Full Stack**: with a combination of both and some tools or frameworks later on.

<br /><br />
